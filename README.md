🕵️‍♂️ Insurance-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to detect fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning classification techniques. The model analyzes customer details and accident-related information to identify patterns that distinguish fraudulent and genuine insurance claims.
The project covers the complete machine learning pipeline, 
starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation, 
focusing on improving fraud detection accuracy and minimizing false claims.

🔹Key steps performed in this project:

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fraud patterns

Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling for model optimization
